FOR a senior person WHO wants to share their skills, learn from others while engaging with the neighbours THE Grown-Up 
Next-Door IS A web application THAT allows senior people within the local community to make friends, share interests, 
organise, and join activities and find useful local information promptly. UNLIKE other applications or platforms that 
are too complex to use and not focusing on senior people.
